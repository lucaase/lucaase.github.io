title: Lab overview

---

Tort Lab is a Brazilian-based neuroscience research lab. Despite enormous advances in our knowledge about the brain, how exactly networks of brain cells give rise to cognitive functions such as learning, memory, reasoning, planning and decision making remains largely unknown. Our lab is generally interested in understanding the neuronal correlates of cognitive processes through computational techniques for analyzing and modeling electrophysiological signals, and as such it is also dubbed Computational Neurophysiology Lab. We currently focus on the following lines of research within Systems Neuroscience:

- Brain rhythms
- Cross-frequency coupling
- Neuronal coding
- Respiration-entrained oscillations

## Where

We are located at the sunny city of Natal, within the Rio Grande do Norte State, at the northeast region of Brazil. Natal, which translates to "christmas" (due to its foundation on a december 25th) is famous for its awesome looking beaches and other astonishing natural landscapes. Since 2011, it has also become home to the [Brain Institute](https://neuro.ufrn.br){:target="_blank"}, a multi-field neuroscience research center within the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, which includes our lab among many others.

Tort Lab is a brazilian-based neuroscience research lab. Despite enormous advances in our knowledge about the brain, it remains largely unknown how exactly networks of brain cells give rise to cognitive functions such as learning, memory, reasoning, planning and decision making. Our lab is generally interested in understanding the neuronal correlates of several cognitive processes through computational techniques for analyzing and modeling electrophysiological signals. We primarily focus on the following lines of research:

- Brain oscillations
- Systems neuroscience
- Respiration-entrained oscillations
- Theoretical neuroscience
- Cross-frequency coupling
- Neuronal coding

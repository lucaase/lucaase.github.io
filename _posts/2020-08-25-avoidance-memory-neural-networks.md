The treatment of fear-related disorders depends on understanding the neural circuits involved in the reconsolidation of aversive memories. Both the consolidation and retrieval of a memory, represented by a cell assembly called engram, are characteristics of an attractor network, observed in several brain regions, such as the amygdala, hippocampus and neocortex.

In research recently published by the Neural Networks journal, Rodrigo Santiago and Adriano Tort used a computational model of attractor networks to describe the boundary conditions of the avoidance memory reconsolidation. In addition to replicating recent experimental results, the model predicts behavioral outcomes for new task scenarios, still standing out for being biologically plausible, based on theories of synaptic plasticity such as Hebbian learning and synaptic degradation by prediction error.
